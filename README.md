The CIPR pipeline can be further tailored to different analytical contexts by excluding irrelevant reference subsets and low-variance reference genes from the analysis. The manuscript describing CIPR and comparing its performance against other similar software was published in [BMC Bioinformatics](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-3538-2).

- [Evaluation of methods to assign cell type labels to cell clusters from single-cell RNA-sequencing data](https://f1000research.com/articles/8-296) - In this study, we benchmarked five methods (CIBERSORT, GSEA, GSVA, ORA and METANEIGHBOR) for the task of assigning cell type labels to cell clusters from scRNA-seq data. We used five scRNA-seq datasets: human liver, 11 Tabula Muris mouse tissues, two human peripheral blood mononuclear cell datasets, and mouse retinal neurons, for which reference cell type signatures were available. Our results show that, in general, all five methods perform well in the task as evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (average area under the curve (AUC) = 0.91, sd = 0.06), whereas precision-recall analyses show a wide variation depending on the method and dataset (average AUC = 0.53, sd = 0.24). GSVA was the overall top performer and was more robust in cell type signature subsampling simulations, although different methods performed well using different datasets. METANEIGHBOR and GSVA were the fastest methods.

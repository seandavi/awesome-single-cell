Simulated datasets and case studies highlight that there are no one method performs the best in all the situations.

We evaluated 45 methods based on four criteria: the accuracy of the trajectory, how scalable the method is, how stable its outputs are, and the usability of the tool. These are summarised in a *"funky heatmap"* (Figures 2 & 3). Check out [dynverse.org](https://dynverse.org) for more information.
- [Evaluation of methods to assign cell type labels to cell clusters from single-cell RNA-sequencing data](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/562082v1) - In this study, we benchmarked four methods (CIBERSORT, GSEA, GSVA, and ORA) for the task of assigning cell type labels to cell clusters from scRNA-seq data. We used scRNA-seq datasets from liver, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and retinal neurons for which reference cell type gene expression signatures were available. Our results show that, in general, all four methods show a high performance in the task as evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis (average AUC = 0.94, sd = 0.036), whereas Precision-Recall curve analyses show a wide variation depending on the method and dataset (average AUC = 0.53, sd = 0.24). CIBERSORT and GSVA were the top two performers.

## People

Gender bias at conferences is a well known problem ([http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2015/07/countering-gender-bias-conferences](http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2015/07/countering-gender-bias-conferences)). Creating a list of potential speakers can help mitigate this bias and a community of people developing and maintaining helps to further diversify this list beyond smaller networks.

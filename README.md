### Rare cell detection

- [FiRE](https://github.com/princethewinner/FiRE) - [python, R, C++] - Finder of rare entities (FiRE) helps identify rare cell types in voluminous single-cell datasets. Design of FiRE is inspired by the observation that rareness estimation of a particular data point is the flip side of measuring the density around it. In principle, FiRE uses the Sketching technique, a variant of locality sensitive hashing, to assign rareness score to every cell.

- [Evaluation of methods to assign cell type labels to cell clusters from single-cell RNA-sequencing data](https://f1000research.com/articles/8-296) - In this study, we benchmarked five methods (CIBERSORT, GSEA, GSVA, ORA and METANEIGHBOR) for the task of assigning cell type labels to cell clusters from scRNA-seq data. We used five scRNA-seq datasets: human liver, 11 Tabula Muris mouse tissues, two human peripheral blood mononuclear cell datasets, and mouse retinal neurons, for which reference cell type signatures were available. Our results show that, in general, all five methods perform well in the task as evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (average area under the curve (AUC) = 0.91, sd = 0.06), whereas precision-recall analyses show a wide variation depending on the method and dataset (average AUC = 0.53, sd = 0.24).

METANEIGHBOR and GSVA were the fastest methods.
